# Architecture — built to evolve

The MVP is deliberately structured so the larger platform (see `VISION.md`) can be
reached **without a rewrite**. The strategy: keep the domain logic pure and
UI-independent, treat events as auditable append-only records, and hide the data
source behind a repository interface.

### `domain/` — the future engine

Pure, framework-free TypeScript. No React, no storage, no I/O. Everything that
makes a recovered dollar *true* lives here and is unit-tested:

- `invariants.ts` — `revenueReturned = collected − baseline` is always derived;
  `isCounted` (rule 2), `isAuditable` (rule 4), `validateEvent`.
- `attribution.ts` — how dollars are credited + the stated baseline methodology.
- `confidence.ts` — transparent, explainable scoring + the proof threshold.
- `metrics.ts` — detected-vs-proven aggregates (rule 5: never blended).
- `reasons.ts` — canonical recovery-reason taxonomy.
- `audit.ts` — append-only audit-entry helpers.

Because this layer is pure, it can later run **server-side, behind an API, or
inside agents** unchanged. The UI computes nothing important itself — it asks the
domain.

> **The governed object lives here.** `RecoveryEvent` (`types.ts`) **is** the Recovery
> Case instance; `PLAYBOOK[leakageType]` (`recommendation.ts`) **is** the RecoveryType
> Definition that creates it. A new recovery workflow is a new Definition, not a schema
> change. See [`RECOVERY_CASE.md`](RECOVERY_CASE.md).

### `data/` — swappable persistence

`RecoveryRepository` is the only thing the app knows about storage.
`localStorageRepo` implements it today. To move to a backend, implement the same
interface against REST/GraphQL — **no UI or domain changes required**.

### `state/` — enforced workflow

Every mutation flows through one `mutate()` path that (1) re-derives
`revenueReturned`, (2) re-scores confidence from the transparent model, (3)
appends an immutable audit entry, (4) persists via the repository. The UI
**cannot** bypass the invariants or skip the audit trail.

### The UI Boundary Rule (business rules never live in React)

The single rule that keeps the prototype honest: **the Presentation layer renders
state and captures actions — it contains zero business-rule logic.** React components
may *read* Case/Proof objects and *call* application functions (`assignOwner`,
`logAction`, `requestVerification`), but may **never**:
- compute or assign an evidence **Tier** (T1/T2/T3);
- compute **Claimed** or **Excluded Recovery**;
- decide whether a new **Proof version** should be generated;
- branch on evidence quality, causal window, or confounder count.

If a component needs to show *"why is this T2 and not T3,"* it asks the Domain layer for
an explanation object — it never re-derives the answer. This is what keeps the domain
usable by a future non-React consumer (backend, agent, mobile) without a rewrite.

> Note: some objects the rule references (Tier, Proof version) are **conceptual / not yet
> in code** — today the domain exposes `confidence` + `isAuditable`. The rule itself
> (business logic out of React) **is** honored today by the pure `src/domain/` layer.

## Evolution hooks (cheap now, valuable later)

| Today (MVP) | Evolves into (platform) |
|---|---|
| Pure `domain/` functions | Server/agent-callable recovery engine |
| Append-only `audit[]` per event | Full event-sourcing / immutable event log |
| `recoveryReason` + `confidence` as first-class fields | Detection/ML feed inputs |
| `RecoveryRepository` over localStorage | REST/GraphQL/event-store backend |
| Single-domain recovery events | Nodes in a Business Event Graph |
| Manual status transitions | Detection, causality, proof, learning agents |

## Target architecture — the three-layer multi-agent OS (deferred)

The end state (VISION.md §6, Phase 4) is **not** one workflow or one dashboard — it is a
**multi-agent commercial operating system**: many specialized agents (Lead, Response,
Quote, Callback, Activation, Payment, Retention, Renewal, QA, Forecast, Anomaly…) running
continuously, all feeding **one shared substrate.** Three layers:

```
Intelligence   the agents/detectors — watch every commercial signal, 24/7
      │        (Detect · Predict · Recommend · Escalate · Learn)
      ▼
Coordination   Case Creation · Risk Scoring · Prioritization · Assignment
      ▼
Proof          Attribution · Recovery Ledger · Revenue Returned · Audit Trail
```

**What already exists is the bottom two layers** — the hard, defensible part. The
Intelligence layer is the green-field. Honest mapping:

| Layer | In the code today | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Proof** | `invariants.ts` · `attribution.ts` · `audit.ts` · `metrics.ts` · `confidence.ts` | ✅ built — the moat |
| **Coordination** | Case + lifecycle · `riskAmount`/`confidence` · `expectedValue` ranking · `owner`+status via `state/mutate()` | 🟡 mostly built (automated Case *creation* is the gap) |
| **Intelligence** | only the rule-based `PLAYBOOK` recommender (advises an existing Case) | ❌ absent — no detectors yet |

**The smallest architecture that supports 100 agents without redesign** rests on one
contract — already specified in [`RECOVERY_CASE.md`](RECOVERY_CASE.md) §2, not yet built:

```
CandidateSignal  →  canBeCase(signal): boolean  →  Recovery Case  →  [shared Proof engine]
```

An **agent = a detector that emits `CandidateSignal`s + a RecoveryType Definition**. Adding
agent #14 or #100 = adding a Definition + a detector; the Case schema, ledger, invariants,
and audit **never change**. The anti-noise primitive: every agent emits the *same governed
object*, so 100 agents converge on **one Case inventory and one ledger** — not 100 alert
streams. The user sees `Revenue At Risk · Findings · Actions`, never 1,000 notifications.

Four primitives must stay right so they don't force a later redesign:
1. the admission gate (`canBeCase`) as a pure, testable predicate;
2. cross-agent dedup + attribution isolation — two agents touching one account must never
   double-open or double-count;
3. the RecoveryType registry as **data**, not typed code (agent #14 shouldn't need a recompile);
4. a **predict** lane on the *forecast* side of the never-blend line — a prediction
   ("78% likely to churn") creates and prioritizes a Case but is **never** counted as
   recovered money (Constitution; VISION.md §2.3).

**The guard.** This is deferred Phase 4. **Build none of it until agent #1 is proven
end-to-end on real data.** One proven agent validates the contract for all 100; one hundred
unproven agents validate nothing and create 100× the noise (VISION.md §2.4 — *"ten agents
is an org chart, not an MVP"*). The bottleneck is demand, not design — the foundation is
already here.

**The standing design test.** Every architectural decision from here is evaluated through
one lens: *does it preserve the path to 50–100 specialized agents without redesign?* This
sits alongside the Build Filter — the Build Filter governs whether to build a thing *now*;
this test governs whether a thing built now **forecloses the swarm later.** If a change
would make agent #14 require a schema / ledger / invariant change, it is wrong.

### The customer never sees agents

The agent fleet is an **internal implementation detail.** The customer sees only:

```
Problem → Action → Recovery → Proof          (market story: Identify · Fix · Prove)
```

They never see "agents," layers, or orchestration. *Customers buy outcomes, not
architecture.* The multi-agent model below is how we reach a trustworthy outcome — never
the pitch.

### Internal reasoning roles (mostly already built)

The fleet is a set of specialized reasoning roles. **Seven of eight already exist as
functions today; only Diagnostic/detection is missing** — and it is the one role that lets
the system *continuously discover* new opportunities rather than analyze ones already
identified. That is Agent #1, the bottleneck.

| Role | Does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Diagnostic / Detection** | continuously discovers potential leaks | ❌ **not built** — the green-field (Agent #1); future detector + `canBeCase` |
| Data Quality | validates evidence + confidence | ✅ `confidence.ts` |
| Prioritization | ranks by expected impact | ✅ `expectedValue` / `expectedRecoverable` |
| Recommendation | proposes corrective actions | ✅ `PLAYBOOK` / `recommend()` |
| Recovery | tracks what changed post-intervention | ✅ Case lifecycle / `state/mutate()` |
| Attribution / Proof | separates real recovery from would-have-happened | ✅ `attribution.ts` + `invariants.ts` |
| CFO | finance-grade explanation + audit | ✅ CFO Proof View + `audit.ts` + `BASELINE_METHODOLOGY` |
| Operator | coordinates the flow | ✅ Recovery Loop / queue / assignment |

The reasoning is largely built; the missing capability is **detection** — continuous
discovery, not analysis of pre-identified cases.

### The Agent Contract (the anti-sprawl primitive)

Before any agent joins the fleet, it must declare a contract — so 100 agents stay governed
instead of becoming sprawl, and so the standing design test is enforceable:

- **Inputs** — what signals it reads.
- **Outputs** — what it emits (a `CandidateSignal`, a score, a recommendation…).
- **Authority** — which decisions it may make autonomously vs. propose.
- **Success metric** — how its value is measured (in its own currency; only Recovery's is money).
- **Evidence requirements** — what proof it must attach.

This extends "an agent = a detector + a RecoveryType Definition + `canBeCase`" into a full,
reviewable spec. No contract, no agent.

### Orchestration — the honest state (reasoning vs. running the loop)

The real question is not "which agents are missing" but *"do these capabilities operate as
one continuously-reasoning Recovery OS?"* Honest answer: they are **coherent** — one data
model (`RecoveryEvent`), one mutation spine (`state/mutate()` re-derives Revenue Returned,
re-scores confidence, and appends audit on every write), one view (the Recovery Loop) — but
the loop is **not yet autonomously orchestrated.**

- **Reasoning is continuous/automatic:** prioritization, recommendation, and proof all
  re-compute on every read/write.
- **Movement between stages is manual:** a human carries each Case `Detect → Fix → Track`.

So the **Recovery Loop is a coherent *read-model of* the lifecycle, not a *runner of* it.**
Continuous operation needs two deferred pieces: (a) the **detector** (Detect = Agent #1),
and (b) an **orchestration runner** that advances Cases through the *automatic* stages,
leaving humans only the genuinely-human Fix. Both gated on Agent #1 proven on real data —
the next architectural question, **not built now** (you don't orchestrate an empty loop).

## Extension points — named seams for open decisions

Open business decisions get a *named home* in the architecture so resolving them later
doesn't require restructuring. **None of these are implemented in this repo** — they are
*named seams* (concepts), so a future implementation has an obvious place to land:

| Extension point | Resolves (eventually) | State in this code |
|---|---|---|
| `ProofTriggerPolicy` | when a new Proof version is generated (tier change / amount delta / manual) | not built — no distinct Proof object yet |
| `RevisionPolicy` | how downward revisions are handled (status, required reason, notification) | not built — no Proof object / no `changeReason` field exists today |
| `OwnershipRoutingPolicy` | how a Case gets an owner (manual / rule / AI-suggested) | owner assignment is manual today (`assignOwner`); no routing policy |
| `SLAPolicy` | timing thresholds per loop stage (stall detection) | not built |
| `LeakTypeAdapter` | the generalization seam — one engine, many leak types | `leakageType` + per-type `PLAYBOOK` exist; a second leak type is the real test |

Architecture's job is to ensure each has a home, not to decide its contents.

### Reserved seams for the Learning layer (design for evolution, implement on evidence)

**Design now, implement later.** The Learning layer must not be *built* before real
proven-outcome data exists — but the architecture must already **reserve its seams**, so a
future learning capability never forces a redesign. These are reserved and **inactive**
(none built); each is anchored to a real, explicit touchpoint in today's code so it can be
activated *without* touching the UI, the ledger, or the invariants:

| Reserved seam | Eventually does | Where it plugs in today (already explicit) |
|---|---|---|
| `LearningEngine` | umbrella: reads proven outcomes, proposes updates | reads `outcomes.ts` / `metrics.ts`; writes only through the seams below |
| `ConfidenceCalibration` | recalibrate the confidence model from realized outcomes | `confidence.ts` is a transparent function, not magic constants — replaceable |
| `PriorUpdates` | update play priors (`probabilityOfSuccess`) from proven recoveries | priors are **explicit fields in `PLAYBOOK`**, updatable as data |
| `PolicyEvolution` | update governance policies from what worked | policies are future/data (§ target architecture) |
| `AgentEvolution` | improve detectors/plays from outcomes | agents are future; each is a RecoveryType Definition + detector |
| `KnowledgeEvolution` / `LessonsLearned` | accumulate the proven **cause→effect library** — the deepest moat | every proven recovery is an append-only record (`revenueReturned` + `audit[]`) |

**Why no redesign will be forced:** the domain is pure; priors (`PLAYBOOK`) and confidence
(`confidence.ts`) are *explicit and transparent*, not hardcoded magic; and every outcome is
already recorded (`revenueReturned`, `audit[]`, `outcomes.ts`). A Learning engine can read
proven outcomes and write updated priors/confidence through these seams **without touching
the UI, the ledger, or the invariants.** That is the design-for-evolution guarantee.

**The guard:** reserved ≠ built. All inactive until real proven-outcome data exists (the
same trigger as everything else — a real customer). Calibrating on no data is calibrating
on nothing. This is also the structural home of the *cumulative learning-with-proof* moat:
each proven Recovery leaves the org smarter, and that library is built from proofs, not
scale — the hardest thing to copy.

## Trust Invariant — The Beneficiary Never Determines the Number

> **North star: the beneficiary never determines the number.** A dollar is counted only
> when it is supported by evidence the beneficiary cannot fabricate or retroactively
> change, under a baseline and definition fixed before the result was known. Once counted,
> the proof is frozen.

A recovery dollar may be counted **only when**:

1. The evidence originates from a source the beneficiary cannot unilaterally alter.
2. The baseline and recovery definition were established **before** the outcome was known.
3. Pre-registration timestamps are tamper-evident and cannot be backdated.
4. The proof captures the exact **model version, policy version, threshold, baseline
   method, evidence references and calculation** used at the time of approval.
5. Once approved, historical proof is **immutable and reproducible forever**.
6. Learning may change **future** decisions only. It must never rewrite historical proof.
7. Excluded Recovery is **mandatory** and cannot silently default to zero.
8. No beneficiary may be the sole author, approver, or verifier of their own recovery claim.
9. Any revision caused by refunds, reversals, disputes, or corrected source data must
   create a **new linked proof revision** — it must never overwrite the original proof.
10. **Claimed revenue is not proven revenue.**

**Standing architecture test** — before approving any design, ask:

> Can the person, team, customer, CFO, manager, or AI agent who benefits from a larger
> recovery number influence the baseline, evidence, timing, attribution, approval, or
> historical calculation? **If yes, reject the design.**

This sits beside the *standing design test* (§ Target architecture): that one guards the
path to many agents without redesign; this one guards the path to a number no beneficiary
can move.

**Non-negotiable learning constraint:** the Learning Layer (and every reserved Learning
seam above) must optimize for **durable, independently verified, post-reversal auditable
outcomes** — never for claimed recovery, raw counted recovery, or short-term proof volume.

## Deliberately deferred

No backend, no auth, no graph database, no agents, no live integrations. These are
**Phase 2+** and intentionally out of scope: the MVP's job is to make one number —
**auditable recovered revenue** — trustworthy. Everything else is added on top of a
number people already trust.

## Testing

`domain/invariants.test.ts` locks the rules that are the product's truth: the core
equation, no-reason exclusion, CFO-auditable gating, and detected/proven
separation. Run with `npm run test`.
